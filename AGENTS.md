# Expo HAS CHANGED

Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v54.0.0/ before writing any code.

You are an expert React Native and Expo engineer helping me build GRIDGO.

Write clean, simple, maintainable code. Prioritize clarity over unnecessary abstraction.

Think like a senior mobile developer.

---

## Project Overview

This repo is **GRIDGO Supplier** — the supplier mobile app for a Davao City managed-printing marketplace. It covers time-sensitive job alerts, accept/decline, production updates, self-QC evidence, pickup handoff, and payout notifications.

GRIDGO ships one app per role. Client, Rider, Operations, and Super Admin surfaces live in separate codebases. Do not put client request flows, rider dispatch, or Operations QA into this binary.

The app includes:

- Assignment inbox with accept / decline inside SLA
- Approved specification and artwork review (read-only of QA-approved files)
- Production progress and self-QC evidence upload
- Pickup handoff readiness
- Payout status notifications (demo ledger via gridgo-api)

**Cross-cutting**

- Auth via the replaceable local demo API (`gridgo-api`). Role must be `supplier`.
- Light and Dark themes with identical labels, states, and workflows.
- Shared design tokens with the client starter (`constants/theme.ts`, `global.css`, logo assets).


## Tech Stack

- Expo
- React Native
- TypeScript
- Expo Router
- NativeWind
- Zustand
- AsyncStorage
- Zustand for client session state
- Local **custom auth + domain API** via `gridgo-api` (MVP — not Clerk/Supabase/PayMongo; replaceable later)

Do not introduce new major libraries unless there is a strong reason. Ask before installing anything new.

---


## MVP stack (current phase)

For this MVP we **do not** integrate Clerk, Supabase, PayMongo, or other production SaaS.

Every screen that needs network uses **`lib/api.ts`** against the shared local **`gridgo-api`**:

- **Custom auth** — email/password → bearer token; role enforced in Zustand session (`store/session.ts`). Mismatched role is rejected (no role switcher).
- **Custom domain API** — orders/jobs, credits, COD, dispatch, proofs, notifications.
- **API base** — `getApiBase()` / `resolveApiBase()` in `lib/api.ts`: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` override, else hostname from Expo `hostUri` (so physical Expo Go uses the LAN IP), Android loopback remapped to `10.0.2.2`, port from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_PORT` (default `8787`). Do not hardcode a developer LAN IP.
- **Zustand** — session and feature stores (not React Context for global session).
- **Money** — PHP minor units only; Pilot Credits + COD ≤ ₱1,500.
- **Replace later** — keep the same `lib/api.ts` surface when Clerk/Supabase/PayMongo land.

Product scope for this binary: **`PRD.md`**. Fleet blueprint: `gridgo-tinker`.

## Development Philosophy

Build feature by feature.

For every feature:

1. Read this file first.
2. Keep the implementation simple.
3. Avoid overengineering.
4. Prefer readable code over clever code.
5. Build the smallest useful version first.
6. Refactor only when repetition appears.

---

## Decision Making

If something is unclear or could be improved, suggest a better approach. If a new library would significantly help, recommend it, explain why, and ask before adding it.

Do not install new libraries without approval.

---

## Architecture

Use this folder structure:

```
app/
  (auth)/
  (tabs)/
components/
constants/
data/
hooks/
lib/
store/
types/
assets/
```

**app/** is for routes and screens only. Screens compose components and call hooks or stores. They should not contain large reusable UI blocks or business logic.

**components/** is for reusable UI. Create a component when it is reused in multiple places, when it makes a screen easier to read, or when it represents a clear UI concept. Examples for this app: `PrimaryButton`, `SecondaryButton`, `StatusChip`, `JobCard`, `SpecRow`, `SelfQcCard`, `CountdownTimer`, `EmptyState`. Do not create components too early.

**data/** holds hardcoded content. Keep it typed.

**store/** holds Zustand stores. Examples of state to keep here: session, theme preference (`system` | `light` | `dark`), the in-progress print request draft (product, size, material, quantity, deadline, address, uploaded artwork), cart/reorder items, order list and selected order, active delivery tracking as received (rider location, ETA, last-updated timestamp, stale flag), and the unread notification count. Persist with AsyncStorage when needed — theme preference, session, and the request draft are worth persisting. Never persist rider location or ETAs; they are someone else's live data and go stale the moment the app is backgrounded.

**lib/** holds external service helpers (clerk.ts, api.ts, cn.ts). Never expose secret keys here.

---

## UI Rules

For any UI task:

- Replicate the provided design exactly.
- Match layout, spacing, padding, font sizes, font hierarchy, colors, border radius, shadows, alignment, and proportions.
- Do not approximate. Do not simplify unless explicitly asked.

---

## Design Tokens

This section is the source of truth for GRIDGO's visual system. When a mockup is provided for a screen, replicate it exactly — the tokens below are what it is built from.

Define tokens once in `constants/theme.ts` and consume them by semantic name. Never hard-code a hex value in a screen or component.

### Color

| Token | Light | Dark | Use |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `canvas` | `#F8F8F8` | `#000000` | Screen background |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | `#141414` | Cards, sheets, navigation |
| `surfaceVariant` | `#F0F0F0` | `#1E1E1E` | Inactive panels, grouping |
| `surfaceHigh` | `#FFFFFF` | `#2A2A2A` | Selected/elevated panel |
| `textPrimary` | `#1A1A1A` | `#F0F0F0` | Headings and core data |
| `textSecondary` | `#4A4A4A` | `#CCCCCC` | Supporting text |
| `textMuted` | `#7A7A7A` | `#808080` | Metadata, inactive labels |
| `outline` | `#DCDCDC` | `#2E2E2E` | Cards, fields, dividers |
| `outlineSubtle` | `#EEEEEE` | `#1E1E1E` | Quiet divider |
| `accent` | `#1A1A1A` | `#F0F0F0` | Monochrome structural control |
| `accentOn` | `#FFFFFF` | `#000000` | Text/icon on accent |
| `brand` | `#D4A017` | `#FFDE58` | Small links and badges, "View all" |
| `actionYellow` | `#FFDE58` | `#FFDE58` | Primary CTA, current step, active nav, map route |
| `success` | `#2E7D32` | `#66BB6A` | Approved, completed |
| `error` | `#C62828` | `#EF5350` | Blocked, failed |
| `warning` | `#F57F17` | `#FFCA28` | Risk, attention |
| `info` | `#1565C0` | `#42A5F5` | Informational, support |

### The yellow rule

`actionYellow` is a finite attention budget, not a brand fill. This is the rule most easily broken and the one that most changes how the product reads.

- One primary CTA per screen or bounded panel. Nothing else.
- Also allowed: the active stepper step, the selected bottom-nav item, and the map route/highlight.
- Navigation, secondary buttons, filters, inputs, tabs, and routine controls stay black/white/charcoal.
- Yellow buttons use black text and a clear verb.
- No yellow page backgrounds and no large black slabs in Light. In Dark, cards must stay visibly elevated from the canvas — never let a surface disappear into black.

### Status

Color never carries meaning alone. Every status is **icon + label + color**: "Approved", "Blocked", "Needs correction", "Last updated 3 min ago". A screen must stay fully readable in grayscale.

### Type

Satoshi for all UI, falling back to `system-ui` until the licensed font files are available. Poppins ExtraBold is brand display only; Instrument Serif is rare decorative text only — never labels, data, or controls.

Scale: display 32/38, H1 28/34, H2 24/30, H3 20/26, body large 16/24, body 14/20, caption 12/16, button 14/20 bold, overline 12/16 medium. Nothing essential goes below 12px.

### Layout and motion

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Spacing base | 4px increments; standard gaps 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 |
| Page padding | 16px |
| Radius | Fields 12; cards 12–16; pills 999. Do not mix arbitrary values |
| Elevation | Border first. Use a subtle shadow only when a border cannot carry the separation |
| Touch target | 44 × 44px minimum for every tappable control |
| Motion | 160–240ms ease-out; respect reduced motion |

No essential state may be communicated by animation alone.

### Theme

Light and Dark are the same product with different presentation — identical navigation, labels, states, validation, and workflows. Follow the system preference with an in-app override.

---

## Styling Rules

Use NativeWind classes. Do not use StyleSheet unless it is not possible to style with className.

Use the NativeWind version installed in this project. Check package.json. Do not upgrade without approval.

Reuse class patterns through utilities in global.css.

### Style Exception List

Use StyleSheet or inline styles for:

- SafeAreaView (className not supported)
- KeyboardAvoidingView (behavior props)
- Modal (visible, transparent props)
- Animated.View (animated style values)
- Dynamic styles calculated at runtime
- Platform specific styles
- Pressable or TouchableOpacity pressed states
- Shadows (different per platform)

Everywhere else, use NativeWind.

---

## Image Rule

Use centralized image imports.

1. Check if constants/images.ts exists.
2. If not, create it.
3. Import all app images there.
4. Use them through the centralized object.

```ts
import mascot from "@/assets/images/mascot.png";

export const images = {
  mascot,
};
```

```tsx
<Image source={images.mascot} />
```

Do not import image assets directly inside screens or components.

---

## State Management

- Zustand for global client state.
- Local state for temporary UI state.
- AsyncStorage for persistence.

---

## TypeScript

- Strict mode.
- No `any`.
- Keep types simple and readable.

---

## Feature Implementation

When building a feature:

1. Read this file first.
2. Identify the files to change.
3. Keep changes focused.
4. Do not rewrite unrelated code.
5. Follow existing patterns.
6. Make sure the feature works end to end.
7. Fix lint and type errors before finishing.

---

## Secrets

- Never expose secret keys in client code.
- Use server routes for tokens, AI calls, and any external API access.

---

## Authentication

Use Clerk. Do not build custom auth, and do not use Supabase Auth.

One Clerk application serves every GRIDGO app, so a person holding two roles keeps one account. The platform role (`client`, `supplier`, `rider`, `ops_admin`, `super_admin`) lives in Clerk `publicMetadata`, is writable only through the Backend API, and reaches this app as a session claim — read it, never write it.

This app serves `client`. Check the role once, at the door, and hand a non-client user off to their own app. That check decides what renders, nothing more: every read and write is decided server-side by Row Level Security against the Clerk user id and role claim, so removing the check would grant no access.

Clients are the only role that signs up. Supplier, rider, and admin accounts exist only by invitation from Operations, so this app never offers a path to create one.

---

## Communication

Be concise. Explain what changed and how to test it.

---

## Final Reminder

Before every feature:

- Read this file.
- Follow it strictly.
- Build clean, simple code.
- Replicate UI exactly when designs are provided.

---

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
